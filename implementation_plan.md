# Interview Questions Generator - Implementation Plan

This document outlines the business rules and implementation tasks for both the backend (Spring Boot) and frontend (SPA) components of the Interview Questions Generator application.

## Business Rules for Developers

### Data Structure and Relationships

1. **Categories and Questions**
   - Each question belongs to exactly one category
   - Categories can contain multiple questions
   - All IDs must be UUIDs
   - Questions must have a difficulty level (junior, intermediate, or senior)
   - Questions must have a topic field (free text)
   - Questions must have at least one answer, with at least one marked as correct

2. **Answers**
   - Each answer belongs to exactly one question
   - Answers must be marked as either correct or incorrect
   - Each answer must have a unique UUID
   - Multiple correct answers for a single question are allowed

3. **Users and Authentication**
   - Users must register with a unique username and email
   - Passwords must be stored in encrypted form
   - User accounts can be enabled/disabled
   - Users can have multiple roles (authorities)
   - Spring Security standard fields must be maintained

4. **Questionnaire Generation**
   - Questionnaires are generated based on three filters:
     - Number of questions (user-specified)
     - Categories (at least one, up to all available)
     - Difficulty levels (at least one, up to all available)
   - The system must select questions that match ALL the specified filters
   - If more questions match the filters than requested, a random subset should be selected
   - Questions should be distributed proportionally across selected categories when possible
   - The order of questions in a questionnaire should be randomized
   - All filters used to generate a questionnaire must be stored for reference

5. **User Sessions and Progress**
   - A user can start a questionnaire, creating a session
   - Sessions track start time, end time, and completion status
   - Users must be able to pause and resume questionnaire sessions
   - The system must track which questions have been answered in a session
   - The system must calculate and store a score when a session is completed

6. **Answer Tracking and History**
   - For each question answered, the system must store:
     - The selected answer
     - Whether it was correct
     - When it was answered
     - How long it took to answer
   - The system must maintain a complete history of all answers for analytics
   - Users should be able to review their answer history and performance metrics

7. **Scoring and Performance**
   - Scores are calculated as the percentage of correct answers
   - Time taken to answer questions should be tracked but not affect scoring
   - Performance metrics should be available by category and difficulty level
   - Historical performance should be tracked to show improvement over time

### Application Flow Rules

1. **Questionnaire Creation Flow**
   - User selects number of questions
   - User selects one or more categories
   - User selects one or more difficulty levels
   - System validates that enough questions exist to meet the criteria
   - System generates and stores the questionnaire
   - System presents the questionnaire to the user or makes it available for later use

2. **Questionnaire Taking Flow**
   - User selects a questionnaire to take
   - System creates a new session
   - User answers questions one by one
   - System records each answer immediately
   - User can navigate between questions freely
   - User can pause the session and resume later
   - When all questions are answered, user can complete the session
   - System calculates and displays the final score and performance metrics

3. **Answer Review Flow**
   - After completing a questionnaire, user can review all questions
   - For each question, the system shows:
     - The question text
     - The user's selected answer
     - The correct answer(s)
     - The explanation for the correct answer
     - Time taken to answer

4. **Performance Analysis Flow**
   - User can view their performance dashboard
   - System displays overall statistics (questions answered, success rate)
   - System shows performance breakdown by category
   - System shows performance breakdown by difficulty level
   - System displays historical performance trends
   - User can filter statistics by date range

### Technical Rules

1. **Database Rules**
   - All tables must use UUID primary keys
   - Timestamps must be stored with timezone information
   - Updated timestamps must be automatically maintained via triggers
   - Foreign key constraints must be enforced
   - Appropriate indexes must be created for performance

2. **Security Rules**
   - API endpoints must be secured with appropriate authentication
   - Role-based access control must be implemented
   - JWT tokens should be used for authentication
   - Passwords must never be stored in plain text
   - Session tokens must expire after a reasonable time

3. **Performance Rules**
   - API responses should be paginated for large result sets
   - Database queries should be optimized for performance
   - Frontend should implement caching where appropriate
   - Long-running operations should be asynchronous

4. **Data Import/Export Rules**
   - The system must be able to import questions and categories from JSON files
   - The system must validate imported data for integrity
   - The system must generate UUIDs for imported data if not provided
   - Users should be able to export their results in a standard format
